## 2. What to bring:

* Lots of water in a plastic bottle, to drink
* Energy snacks
* A small medi-kit with bandages, plasters, tape etc.
* Just enough money for pay-phone, food, transportation.
* Watch, paper, pen for accurate documentation of events, police brutality, injuries.
* Inhaler, epipen, insulin or other meds if applicable.
* Several days of prescription medication and doctor's note in case of arrest.
* Menstrual pads, if needed. Avoid using tampons - if you're arrested you may not have a chance to change it (tampons left in for more than six hours increase your risk of developing toxic shock syndrome)

## 3. What not to do:

* Don't wear things that can easily be grabbed (ie. Dangly earrings or other jewellery, ties, loose hair)
* Don't go to the demo alone, if you can help it. It is best to go with an affinity group or some friends who know you well.
* Don't forget to eat food and DRINK LOTS OF WATER.
* Don't drink alcohol before a demo.
* Don't take drugs before a demo or carry them with you. This includes cannabis.
* Don't bring any ID, if possible.

Chants look kinda good in a blockquote:

<blockquote>1. Here’s a chant!</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Here’s another chant!</blockquote>

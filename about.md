### So what is this?

This is a demonstration of possible solutions to several protest-related problems:

1. During some of the most recent big protests, lots of people participating in them had never been to a protest before and didnâ€™t have the experience of basic protest safety. 

2. When large groups of people gather in one area of a city, say for a mass protest, the local cell towers have problems dealing with all the traffic. This makes data speeds slow for everyone at the protest and can make it difficult to load important information about the protest.

3. Act as a moderated news source of information directly relevant to protestors.
